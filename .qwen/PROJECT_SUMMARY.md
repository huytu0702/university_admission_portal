Implement a University Admission Portal that demonstrates the impact of various architectural design patterns by allowing toggling between "Before" (baseline) and "After" (improved) implementations.

## Key Knowledge
- Technology Stack: Next.js 15 + shadcn UI (Frontend), NestJS (Backend), PostgreSQL (Database), Redis + BullMQ (Queuing)
- Architecture: Baseline synchronous vs Improved queue-based with outbox pattern
- Key Design Patterns: Queue-Based Load Leveling (required), Competing Consumers, Priority Queues, Cache-Aside, Idempotency, Retry with Backoff and DLQ, Circuit Breaker, Bulkhead, Outbox, CQRS-lite
- Project has 6 milestones, with milestone 1 (MVP Baseline) and milestone 2 (Admin Flags + Queue Core) completed
