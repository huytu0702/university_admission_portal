# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Build a University Admission Portal demonstrating architectural design patterns with both synchronous baseline implementation and enhanced asynchronous patterns for improved scalability and resilience.

## Key Knowledge
- **Technology Stack**: NestJS backend with TypeScript, PostgreSQL database with Prisma ORM, Next.js 15 frontend with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui
- **Architecture**: Modular design with authentication, applications, payments, documents, and email services
- **Patterns Implemented**: JWT auth, file uploads, payment processing, email notifications, request logging, error tracking, metrics collection, health checks
- **Testing**: Unit tests for auth module, integration tests for application submission, load testing with k6/Locust
- **Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI API docs, baseline performance metrics, comprehensive README files
- **Deployment**: Docker containerization with docker-compose for easy setup

## Recent Actions
- Completed all 49 planned tasks including backend API, frontend UI, testing, documentation, and load testing
- Implemented comprehensive authentication system with registration/login and JWT tokens
- Built application processing workflow with file uploads, document verification, and payment processing
- Created responsive Next.js frontend with multi-step application form and status tracking
- Developed extensive documentation including API docs, performance metrics, and run instructions
- Set up complete testing suite with unit, integration, and load tests
- Containerized entire application with Docker for easy deployment
