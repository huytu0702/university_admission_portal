      - Created integration tests for application submission
      - Generated API documentation with Swagger/OpenAPI
      - Documented baseline performance metrics
      - Created comprehensive load test scripts with k6 and Locust

   4. Monitoring and Observability
      - Added request logging middleware
      - Implemented basic error tracking
      - Created metrics collection for latency
      - Added endpoint response time tracking
      - Set up basic health check endpoint

  Key Features Implemented

   - Synchronous Processing: Core functionality implemented with synchronous processing as baseline
   - Authentication: Secure JWT-based authentication with registration and login
   - File Uploads: Multi-file upload with validation and size/MIME type checking
   - Payment Processing: Mock payment service with checkout and webhook handling
   - Email Notifications: Automated email sending for confirmations and status updates
   - Application Tracking: Complete status tracking with progress indicators
   - Security: Comprehensive security measures including validation, sanitization, and CORS

  Performance Considerations

   - Documented baseline performance metrics for future comparison
   - Created load testing scripts to evaluate system under stress
   - Implemented proper error handling and logging throughout
   - Added metrics collection for latency and response time tracking

Next Steps
